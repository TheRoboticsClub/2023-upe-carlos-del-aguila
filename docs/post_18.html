                        <p>The AWS virtual machines were setted up: one with just CPUs and RAM, and another with an extra GPU. All tests were completed and the remote backends work perfectly, although the perfomance are not as good as we thought (technically, an exercise needs 0.6 RTF to work properly, but we managed to get to 0.3-0.4 RTF).</p>
                        <p>The VM with a GPU was setted up and also tested, although Docker is not using it to improve the perfomance. This must be addressed and investigated.</p>
                        <p>Also, the problem with the REACT exercises has been fixed. It seems that the RADI wasn't launching the RAM properly, but now that I've launched it manually, It works perfectly fine. </p>
                        <p>This will be my last entry on this logbook. My internship will be completed today. I am thankful of have been given this oportunity to work on this project and I'm quite sure that on the future this will be a very useful platform to learn robotics. Carlos signing out</p>
                        <p>Update: Here are some videos of the RADI working on AWS: </p>
